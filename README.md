## Issues / Bugs
- CSS is broken on mobile iOS devices
- Synth limited to one tone sounding off at a time. This causes a subsequently played note to be cut off when the previous key is unpressed.

## Future improvements

- Rewrite project to entirely exist in vanilla javascript. 
- Change simple synth tones to melodica sound files.
